# Firebase Learning Project

This project is built for learning Firebase. The project is designed to provide hands-on experience and practical examples for understanding Firebase's capabilities in developing web applications.

## Backend Framework

The backend of this project has been built with the Express framework. Express is a popular and lightweight web application framework for Node.js, known for its simplicity and flexibility. It provides a robust set of features to build efficient and scalable web applications.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The project incorporates the principles and concepts of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). DDD is an approach to software development that emphasizes creating software that closely aligns with the business domain it serves. It promotes a clear separation of concerns and enables developers to focus on modeling and solving complex business problems.

## Repository for Inspiration

This project takes inspiration from the [CodelyTV TypeScript DDD Example](https://github.com/CodelyTV/typescript-ddd-example/tree/master) repository. It serves as a valuable resource for learning TypeScript and implementing Domain-Driven Design principles in a real-world project. The examples and insights from this repository have influenced the development of this Firebase learning project.
